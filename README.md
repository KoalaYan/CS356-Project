## Project 1: Android process tree
This project contains a system call with module which shows
the process tree of android, some executable files to present the relationship between parent process and children, and a simulation of Burger Buddies problem.

## Project 2: Out of memory killer
This project modifies kernel code to implement a system call to set memory limit and a user-oriented out-of-memory killer,
which will check whether there are some users' occupied memory exceeding the limit.
